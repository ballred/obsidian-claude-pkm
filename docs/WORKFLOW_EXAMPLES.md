## Tips for Workflow Success

1. **Start Small**: Master daily notes before adding complexity
2. **Be Consistent**: Same time, same process, every day
3. **Iterate Weekly**: Adjust what's not working
4. **Track Patterns**: Notice what helps or hinders
5. **Automate Gradually**: Add automation as patterns stabilize

Remember: Workflows should reduce friction, not add it. If something feels heavy, simplify it.
